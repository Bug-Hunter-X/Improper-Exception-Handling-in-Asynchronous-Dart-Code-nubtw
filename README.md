# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: inadequate exception handling within asynchronous functions. The provided Dart code showcases an example where exceptions are caught but not handled effectively, potentially masking the root cause of errors.  The solution improves exception handling, making error analysis easier.

## Problem

The original code catches exceptions but uses `rethrow`, propagating errors without providing specific context or logging details. This makes debugging difficult.

## Solution

The solution refactors exception handling to provide more detailed logging and more granular error identification.  Instead of a generic catch-all, the solution handles specific exception types to address the problem more effectively. This allows for improved error messages and better debugging capability.
